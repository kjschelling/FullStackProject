  This app is designed for specificly for modeling agencies. With this site
the agency can sign up, sign in, change password, and sign out.

 While logged in the agency (user) can create a new
model. Update an existing model, show the current models they represent and delete
a model.

Planning:

When starting this project, I originally wanted to do client(user) goes through agencies that have many models.
I than decided to simplify it to agency(user) has many models.

After setting up my remote repositories and initalizing my front and back end, I started on the user authentication.
Once the auth was working I moved to the backend.
-added my models table
-added the relationships

Next I focused on creating the model, and displaying the models.
Once those were working, it was on to getting a single model using the id and deleting a single model using the id.

Once those were functional, it was on to the styling and adding the finishing touches.

Technologies used to create project:
  -HTML
  -CSS
  -Sass
  -Javascript
  -jQuery
  -Ajax
  -Bootstrap
  -Handlebars

Future Iterations of this project will contain:
 -pictures associated with the models
 -be able to specify which field user wants to update
 -user will be clients instead of agency
    - client goes through agencies that have many models
